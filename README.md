# Read me!

Hello, welcome to my personal site! I know it may not look like much at the moment, but please bear with me as I'm just a beginner!
I've done some coding courses in the past, however I'm mostly learning as I go :) 

Practice makes perfect, so hopefully I can get myself to keep working on this programming stuff and something cool will come out of it!

To-do:

- Mobile formatting (make the bubbles move to the top when the window is narrow)
- Make a sicc new logo
- ~~Create extras page~~
- ~~Add articles to extras page~~
- Add other projects??? (but what tho??)
- FInish Insomniac FFS >:(
- Add designs (maybe logo designs?)
- RENAME TO index.html

If i have time:
- do something cool with paper.js :D
