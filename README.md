Hello, welcome to my personal site! I know it may not look like much at the moment, but please stay tuned as I'm just a beginner!
I've done some coding courses in the past, however I'm mostly learning as I go :) 

Practice makes perfect, so hopefully I can get myself to keep working on this programming stuff and something cool will come out of it!
